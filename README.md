Purpose
The notebook focuses on cleaning and transforming a global climate change dataset to prepare it for further analysis.
Key goals: understand the data structure, handle missing/inconsistent values, convert to a tidy format, and export a cleaned dataset.
Steps and Methods
Library Import and Setup

Loads pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn.
Configures pandas to display all columns.
Load and Inspect Data

Reads a CSV file containing climate data with countries, series (climate indicators), and data from 1990â€“2011.
Shape: (13,512 rows, 28 columns).
Displays a preview of the dataset.
Initial Data Exploration

Prints summary statistics and counts of missing values per column.
Most time-series columns (years) have substantial missing data (~25% missing per year).
Project Goals (Markdown)

Clarifies project steps: data understanding, cleaning, tidying, and export.
Missing Value Analysis

Calculates and prints the ratio of missing values for each column.
Data Cleaning

Converts string columns to numeric where possible, coercing errors to NaN.
Renames columns: lowercases, replaces spaces with underscores.
Removes columns/rows that are entirely empty.
Data Transformation (Commented/Optional)

Suggests reshaping data using melt or pivot, though not executed.
Further Cleaning

Drops rows and columns with more than 10% missing data.
Shows remaining missing values and cleaned data shape.
The final cleaned DataFrame at one point has 3103 rows and 0 columns (likely due to aggressive missing-data filtering).
Export

Exports cleaned data as cleaned_climate_data.csv.
In summary:
The notebook demonstrates a full workflow for cleaning a climate change dataset, focusing on missing value analysis, type conversion, renaming, and removal of empty data. The final result is a cleaned CSV file ready for further analysis, though the last cleaning step may remove all columns if too strict a threshold is used.
